			I've taken time off in 2021 and I'm using some of it to get to grips with a little 3D
			modelling.
		</p>
		<p>
			3D media is growing rapidly, on the web and accross the tech industry and in the near future
			as web developers I reckon be working with 3D files just like we work with videos and photos.

			gets a lot of good publicity and it sounds like it has had a lot of recent development to make
			it easier than ever to get going with. Also it's completely free! I found some great tutorials
			online [link tutorial] and some fun demonstrations [link cool] of the new Blender features and
			I felt inspired to dive in.

			Blender provides many tools for creating 3D objects and animations. Here are a few I've found
			useful so far (there are many, many, more).
		</p>

		<ul class="wordcloud">
			<li>Mesh</li>
			<li>Materials</li>
			<li>Shaders</li>
			<li>Lights</li>
			<li>Physics simulations</li>
			<li>HDRI Environment Backgrounds</li>
			<li>Reflections</li>
			<li>Transparency</li>
			<li>Emmitance lighting</li>
			<li>Displacement maps</li>
			<li>Keyframe animations</li>
			<li>Rigging</li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section>
		<p>
			Playing with materials, HDRI backgrounds, reflections, soft-body simulations. You can see the
			orange ball doesn't reflect properly whilst rolling.

		<h2>Displacement orbs</h2>
		<p>
			It may not look like it but for each of the objects below the mesh is a perfect sphere but
			with a displacement map applied. Usually displacement maps are used to create small bumps and
			dips on objects but here the same technique has been pushed to the extreme to produce heavily
			distorted alien looking objects.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoKdneGFXnE">Chris P's tutorial</a> for teaching
			me to create these.

				><em>Note:</em> this is one of the cases where your choice of rendering engine within Blender
				makes a dramatic difference. Initially I'd selected the Eevee rendering engine but the displacement
				maps didn't do anything. As soon as I switched to the Cycles engine it all came together.</small

		<h2>Ducky</h2>
		<p>
			I decided to sketch ducky a couple of times to get a feeling for the personality and
			positioning of elements before I spent time animating in Blender. If I was more familiar with
			Blender at this point I'd try out the Blender Greecepencil tool for this step.

		<h2>What's next?</h2>
		<p>
			I've got a ways to go with learning Blender but at the end of the day I'm a web developer so
			next I'm going to play with loading 3D assets into the browser. I'll probably reach for the
			<LogoSticker logokey="three" /> Three.js library and I'm going to be limited by both Three's featureset
			as well as the normal web considerations such as performance and asset download size.
