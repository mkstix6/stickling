				This year's Advent of Code story was about exploring a deep ocean trench in a mini-submarine
				and solving problems with the instruments and navigation as you diver deeper and deeper.
			</p>
			<p>
				This year I decided to break from my JavaScript day-to-day and attempt every puzzle using <LogoSticker
					logokey="python"
				/> <strong>Python</strong>:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I practiced a lot of data manipulation in Python.</li>
				<li>
					Learned how to use List Comprehensions where I would usually reach for JavaScript
					<code>Array.prototype.map()</code>
				</li>
				<li>
					Unerstood that I had to import reduce rather than relying on it just being there as in
					JavaScript.
				</li>
				<li>
					Used a Lambda function or two which <em>feel</em> a lot like JavaScript Arrow Functions.
				</li>
				<li>
					Figured out basic unit-testing in Python. As Python's <code>unittest</code> is readily importable
					this was much nicer than the JavaScript experience of having to decide which of many test runners
					to choose.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				I managed a score of <span class="adventYellow">21*</span>. A little better than last year.
				Looking forward to completing every star one year ðŸ’ª.
